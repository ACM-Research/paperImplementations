Title: MorphBodies (?): Evolutionary AI to improve soft robotic

Overview: By using Evogym, I am able to perform an experiment on different types of modular controllers on multiple different soft robots; it allows for speculative use of actuators and compares its with previous versions of the current robots body with an evolutionary algorithm to find better and more efficient flexible robotic designs.


Limitations/Weakness
•	Only is 2D and therefore not completely realistic
•	limited environment choices

Strengths
•	Rapidly optimize different control features 
•	Allows for computer design prototyping  
•	Allows for Brain and Body optimization 
	

Novelty
•	Evolutionary Algorithms
•	using Soft Robots to do normal tasks
