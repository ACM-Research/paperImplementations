# GPT 1 Implementation

This is an implementation of the basic framework of GPT 1 from the paper
"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training"  
It's trained on the OpenWebCorpus. The model I trained for around 10 hours is stored on a pkl, file which is not included because of space saving, although I can provide it if asked. But you can see the remnants of the code in gpt.ipynb where the pkl file would've gone.

The synopsis and notes I took on the paper are in synopsis.md
