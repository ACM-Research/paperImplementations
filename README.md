# [Effect of sympathetic relation and unsympathetic relation in multi-agent spoken dialogue system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7803128)

This paper is about a multi-agent conversation and studying the effects of using sympathetic speech when engaging with users. Sympathetic speech is defined as speech from the agent that revolves around the user, for example, if the user were to talk about udon as the paper states, the agents would also focus on the topic of udon. The agents would discuss it with the user and with each other. The criteria for comparing sympathetic and unsympathetic speech systems were: natural conversation, interesting conversation, various opinions, familiarity with the agent, lively conversation, and like chatting, all on a 5-point Likert scale. The results indicated that sympathetic speech systems could provide significantly better lively conversations. A more interesting result was that unsympathetic speech systems performed better in providing various opinions, which may be due to sympathetic speech focusing on the user.
The paper also compares multi-agent sympathetic speech systems with sing-agent sympathetic speech systems with the same criteria as before. The results here indicate that multi-agent sympathetic speech systems significantly perform better in providing lively conversation and in making the conversation feel like an actual chat.
Given the existing literature on multi-agent systems and on the effects of empathetic speech, the paper set out to find out how both concepts together could provide a livelier conversation. The main limitation of the system was in how their response generator could only work for a few general topics rather than any general topic the user chooses. This can be solved as I did in my implementation by using a GPT model and prompt engineering it to be able to respond to any topic.
